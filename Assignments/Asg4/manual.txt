USER MANUAL:
Compiling: gcc jumpingbozons.c -lm
Run: ./a.out <M> <S> <Y>

TESTING:
Most of the testing was done in the UofC MS lab, however some of it was also
done with my laptop from home.

The summary is in the PDF.

BONUS IMPLEMENTED:
TO GET BONUS RESULTS: replace "response_time = getExponentialVar();" with
"response_time = 10.0;"

Normal test results (random duration):
M = 10, S = 50.000 and Y = 25.000

        Total time observing channel: 1000000.000
        Total silent time = 17929.887990
        Total melodious time = 87383.914987
        Total screechy time = 894690.846529
        SILENT time on the channel = 1.793%
        MELODIOUS time on the channel = 8.738%
        SCREECHY time on the channel = 89.469%
        Attempted yodel time = 132829.000000
        Perfect yodel percentage = 14.354%

Bonus test results (fixed time duration is 1000000.0):
M = 10, S = 50.000 and Y = 25.000

        Total time observing channel: 1000000.000
        Total silent time = 164849.584210
        Total melodious time = 322420.157968
        Total screechy time = 512739.405933
        SILENT time on the channel = 16.485%
        MELODIOUS time on the channel = 32.242%
        SCREECHY time on the channel = 51.273%
        Attempted yodel time = 166153.000000
        Perfect yodel percentage = 54.203%

According to the results, performance becomes much better as the silent
percentage increases by ~15%, the melodious percentage also inceases by 23%,
and the screechy percentage decreases by about 40%. The attempted yodel time
increases while the perfect yodel percentage increases significantly (~40%).
