USER MANUAL:
To use the Web Proxy:
1. Go to a web browser (I used Firefox)
2. Open menu on the right side of the URL and search bar
3. Select "Preferences"
4. Go down to Network Proxy
5. Click "Settings..."
6. Change the Configure Proxy Access to the Internet to "Manual proxy configuration"
7. Type "localhost" on HTTP proxy and "12345" on the port
8. Click "Use this proxy server for all protocols"
7. Click "Ok" to finish

How to compile this program:
gcc proxy.c -o proxy

How to run this program:
./proxy

After running this program, go to the web browser and type in an url
(ie.http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/test3.html) then press enter to load the page.
If it says's "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified" then simply press CTRL-F5 then it will respond with
HTTP/1.1200 OK. You may redirect to another page if you desire.
Lastly, to exit the program press CTRL-c.

The testing of this program was done solely at the university.
The things that work are the proxy and redirecting.
Although I am able to parse through the HTTP requests and responses correctly (I tested by printing it
out), I am unable to insert random characters anywhere except from the beginning or the end of a line
because of the way my parsing is done.

As for things that don't work (or isn't doing what it's supposed to), one of them is my function for
parsing through the body of the HTTP reponse and seperating the header from the body.

Things that I have yet implement:
1. Parsing to find the Content-Type (but I do get the Content-Length with the contentLength func)
2. Inserting the error based on Content-Type (only on txt and html files)

But I was able to make a function that prints a random character called randomChar

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to experiment much with HTTP parsing due to being stuck all the times.
So, I admit this assignment was quite hard (if only) to implement the ideas that I've had.
I came up with different ways to parse yet they all seem to not do what I thought they did.

NOTE: If the program outputs "Binding failed." then change the PORT inside proxy.c and firefox settings OR wait for a moment (about a minute).
